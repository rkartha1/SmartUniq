     The program must be compiled with less than 4 arguments so that the program can find output the file provided correctly. In addition, it is\
    assumed that the user knows what arguments to use or else there will be an error message that will be be presented. If the program has no arguments except for the file name, then it simply just presents the file with removed duplicates. If the program presents the -i arguments, then it will present the file with removed duplicates in terms of case insensitivity. If the program presents the -c arguments, then it will present the file with the count of duplicates as well as removed duplicates. It is considered to be more efficient and "smarter" than the "uniq" command.
